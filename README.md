USB Keystroke Injector Script Generator via Keystroke Recording.

Unlike Macro recorder/replayer apps such as TinyTask, USB Keystroke Injectors do not require permission to run any programs such as .exe or .bat files in order to function. This means the resulting replay works with highly locked-down computers.

Unlike traditional USB keystroke injectors, no coding is required and this runs on DigiSpark Arduino Boards.
